# What it does

Aniverse serves the purpose of an online database with a few social network features.

At the moment it's possible to search titles by name, genre, release year and season, and by registering users can add titles to a personal list, send-accept-decline friend requests, write their own profile info, and post comments on their own diary or other people's.


# Tools & Tech 

Aniverse was mainly created in Visual studio using .NET Core MVC framework. SQL and Entity framework were used for database management, and data on titles is pulled from the Anilist API which has a GraphQL model.

# Roadmap
- [x] Website online
- [] Restructuring into React+TS and .NET REST API
